# Native Linux game integration

Work in progress on `feature/linux-x64`, continuing the verified shared-renderer
foundation. No game acceptance is claimed until recorded in STATUS.

`tools/build/build-native-linux.py --game-dir PATH --setup --generate --test`
uses the same runtime/XBE/Python pins, complete patch stack and generator as
Windows/Mac. It keeps one game build in `build/linux/game`, with source/binary/
compatibility receipts in BUILD.json. Game data is read from the supplied
existing directory, not copied. Use Clang in the native Ubuntu working checkout.
Final patch2402 extends the title/input/audio guards after2401 and selects only
OS-specific Linux files. Shared SDL input/audio, binding/settings/debug models,
textures, gameplay patches and Xbox/Vulkan frontend compile directly.

`src/native/main.c` is the same native entry point on Mac/Linux. `mmio_linux.c`
maps Linux x64 ucontext registers to the bounded scalar MOV decoder in
`x64_access.h`; unknown instructions/address mismatches fail closed. ARM64 and
x64 adapters call one `mmio_device.h` policy for APU, CRTC acknowledgement and
AC97 reset, using existing writable aliases without page protection changes.
`tests/gameplay/native_mmio_linux.c` checks decoding and actual SIGSEGV recovery.

`crash_posix.c` retains the same shared mmap/helper/health/breadcrumb/report
pipeline. Darwin keeps Mach/CoreGraphics/CoreText/CommonCrypto services; Linux
uses ucontext, process_vm_readv, OpenSSL and addr2line. Linux guest-memory reads
may be denied by normal ptrace policy; per-region capture status records failure
without elevation. Linux hang sampling has no live stack provider and focus is
the last SDL observation, not an external desktop query. Linux ELF uses -no-pie
for deterministic addr2line addresses; report metadata says linux-x64.

`text_bitmap_linux.c` adapts Fontconfig/FreeType to the existing RHI bitmap
callbacks. `settings_linux.c` supplies folder dialogs and shared debug attachment;
the Linux editing/debug dialogs are pending (explicit self-test skip77). Common
in-game Video Options and controls JSON remain available, with unsupported
saved fields preserved. Its graphics check tests shared resolution apply/restore,
not GUI parity. `online_linux.c` supervises the same Python Online companion/
handshake and uses shared network policy; portable release packaging is pending.

`tools/testing/test-native-linux.py` bounds game runs to600s, locks
`private/test-saves/native-linux`, isolates all input/display/save/XDG/crash paths,
and skips startup movies like the routine Windows runner. `--capture` retains two
rotating BMPs under `private/captures/native-linux`; `--test-keys` consumes the
existing synthetic SDL event format. Test scripts never use personal configs/saves.
Successful presents and captures are separate from visually reviewed gameplay.
Initial Linux movie decoding is unavailable until the pinned FFmpeg integration
is adapted; this must stay explicit in manifests/documentation.

The shared native test-disk recycler also permits the two exact Linux test roots;
it still rejects redirected paths and unknown partition names. Completed tests
recycle only their known disposable partitions; user saves are never selected.

Use the project-owned guest_arena_service API for MMIO maps/aliases and test
arenas. The former w32_guest_* compatibility aliases were retired; native ARM64
and x64 fixtures now call the same canonical provider. Patch2403 imports OpenSSL
in the input subdirectory where its non-global imported target is consumed.

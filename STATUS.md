# Measured progress

Tested on Windows on October 14-15, 2026. This is an experimental port bring-up;
full gameplay and campaign completion have not been verified.

## Live Classic / 4K texture toggle — October 15

- F10 switches the cached original/replacement texture views without restarting
  or reloading a level. PC Settings > 4K Textures also switches the mode and
  shows its checkmark. Keyboard repeats are ignored; fullscreen and hidden-menu
  shortcuts work. F10 no longer also cycles the runtime's diagnostic frame cap.
- Play.cmd starts Classic with the installed local pack available; Play-Textures
  starts 4K. Packaged launchers discover an optional Textures folder beside Play.
  This session choice is independent of render resolution. Missing, invalid and
  memory-budget-limited replacements retain Classic; original assets stay intact.
- Windows Release build and all build-time native checks passed. Counted RHI
  loader tests cover cached switches, unchanged original data, missing/invalid
  DDS files, screen copies/render targets, content changes, allocation failures
  and release. Seven fresh/upgrade/idempotence patch-stack tests passed.
- One brief actual-runtime startup smoke check passed F10, held repeats, hidden
  menu, fullscreen, menu selection/checkmarks, one replacement load, clean exit,
  and personal controls/display settings preservation. Evidence is in
  logs/texture-toggle-validation.json and logs/texture-toggle-game.err.
- Full gameplay scene/artwork validation remains pending under the existing
  overhaul cadence. The current partial pack and 512 MiB resident GPU budget
  are unchanged. Disposable validation disk images were recycled after the run.

## Display settings and texture preview — October 15

- The working build now adds **Display settings** through the US game's own
  button builder in main Settings and paused Options. Resolution selection,
  Apply, Keep and Revert all use guest menu widgets and navigation.
- 1080p, 1440p, 4K and monitor-reported modes are offered. Rendering targets and
  depth buffers resize live; a 15-second unconfirmed preview returns to the old
  resolution. Confirmed settings persist beside the PC input configuration.
- The US camera wrapper updates the perspective matrix and horizontal CPU
  frustum together. The HUD retains its proportions in a centered 4:3 region.
  Front-end menus retain the original layout. Fullscreen remains Alt+Enter.
- The actual-menu replay verified 1080p apply/save, 1440p preview, timeout
  rollback, and return to the original menu. Native tests cover resolution
  bounds, monitor-mode deduplication, failed allocation handling at the API
  boundary, aspect calculations and persistence. Original game files, saves
  and keyboard/mouse configuration passed 424 protected-file hash comparisons.
- First-mission runs rendered 3840×2160 and 3440×1440 scene buffers and reached
  paused Options without a recorded crash or unresolved indirect call. The
  resolution checks use GPU render targets on the available display; a physical
  ultrawide monitor, split screen, and a full campaign are not validated.
- The expanded texture preview contains 11 replacements, approximately 44 MiB,
  covering selected terrain, masonry, timber, concrete, floor tiles, metal panels
  and one weapon atlas. Four replacements loaded in a 174-second opening-mission
  run at 1920×1080; gameplay and paused Options were reached without a recorded
  crash or unresolved call. The remaining seven need scene-specific runtime checks.
- DDS files have complete mip chains: two 4096×4096, eight 2048×2048, and one
  2048×1024. Square source art is 1254×1254; stone masonry is 1774×887. These are
  resampled outputs, not native 4K generated art. A character draft shifted facial
  and ear UV details and was kept out of the active pack.
- The coverage audit tracks 5,547 supported texture keys: 11 installed, one draft
  requiring correction/review, and 5,535 awaiting art. Another 753 cataloged
  payloads use unsupported formats. Embedded textures may remain undiscovered.
  This is not a completed game remaster. Eight offline tool tests pass; installed
  DDS hashes, dimensions and mip chains pass the audit. All 427 protected game,
  save and settings files matched their pre-test hashes; temporary disks and
  frame captures were recycled. Exact new prompts and real source sizes are saved.
- Pack compilation enforces the user's 6 GiB cap including metadata. Runtime
  replacement residency remains capped at 512 MiB. The supported-asset size plan
  is approximately 2.5 GiB before source art and unsupported-format additions;
  the plan is not completed artwork or a guarantee of final full-game size.
- Runtime changes are reproducible from the pinned upstream revision using
  `pc-controls.patch`, `save-routing.patch`, and `texture-pack.patch`; the last
  patch includes the renderer wiring shared by display and texture features.
  Fresh application in setup order and repeat-build checks pass.

## Completed

- Online source-build integration: a new network-menu entry, HTTPS browser with
  certificate fingerprint checking, public/private rooms, compatible-only
  listing/joining, peer credentials and leases, and a virtual-address bridge
  using the game host's forwarded UDP port. Guests establish outbound paths;
  the host relays guest-to-guest traffic. Two local instances used Online and
  an HTTPS directory to join a 2/16-player lobby and enter the same Shrink match.
  Cross-internet routing and full-match stability remain unverified. Campaign
  co-op remains a separate future effort.
  Automatic hosting now detects public IPv4 over HTTPS, starts/stops a local
  directory with the bridge, reuses its certificate and offers a copyable
  invitation containing the directory address, fingerprint and join code.

- Experimental PC System Link: native framed UDP, strict build/content identity
  checks, default-protocol discovery sockets, and XNADDR/key mapping. Two isolated
  game instances discovered a match, joined a 2/16-player lobby, and loaded into
  the same Thief match. This is a same-PC loopback test, not a cross-network test
  or a completed-match validation. See [multiplayer status](docs/multiplayer.md)
  for the later Online integration and remaining cross-network validation.

- Read the supplied desktop Xbox ISO without modifying it; extracted 412 files.
- Confirmed the US executable, title ID `45410066`, entry point `0038024D`,
  XDK 5849 and the expected SHA-256 documented in `README.md`.
- Identified 379 Xbox library symbols, including six upstream manual symbols.
- Generated 15,838 C function bodies with zero reported translation failures,
  totaling 2,507,843 lines across 16 chunks plus support files.
- Built `build/windows/Release/futureperfect_recomp.exe` with Visual Studio
  2022 / MSVC 19.44.35224 for Windows x64.
- Compiled and loaded FFmpeg 8.1 movie support.
- Fixed native profile device paths that bypassed `RECOMP_SAVE_DIR`, and
  preserved the fix in `patches/save-routing.patch`. Ten native path regression
  checks pass, including asset routing and switching between save directories.
- Added player-1 keyboard/mouse controls: normalized WASD movement, Windows raw
  relative mouse motion, direct camera-angle updates, mouse buttons and wheel,
  editable sensitivity/invert-Y settings, focus-loss clearing and cursor
  capture/release. The launcher loads `config/pc-controls.json`.
- Preserved the host integration and camera wrapper in `patches/pc-controls.patch`;
  the generated original `sub_000D2B80` body remains available as `_gen`.

## Validation

- Upstream Python suite: 547 passed, 41 skipped, 87 subtests passed.
- Upstream unittest discovery: 289 tests passed, including 26 skipped.
  This overlaps the pytest suite and is not an additional independent total.
- CPU differential conformance: 5,741 instruction vectors and 211 function
  vectors, zero mismatches.
- First 35-second startup test: decoded the EA and Free Radical intro movies
  (88 and 81 pictures), submitted PCM movie sound, reached the rendered
  player-count menu, and remained running until the test stopped it.
  No crash or unresolved indirect call was logged. Frame captures were
  inspected, including the player-count menu.
- Second 35-second input test: scripted A presses reached profile name entry;
  the captured name-entry screen was inspected.
- A subsequent 70-second test reached Story difficulty selection. It also
  exposed profile contamination through the original runtime's save-path bug.
  Earlier test profiles are preserved in `private/pre-fix-test-saves`.
- After fixing save routing, a fresh 100-second run created its profile under
  the requested test save directory, reached the first mission briefing, loaded
  `2401: Time to Split`, and rendered its opening cutscene and the landing scene.
  No crash or unresolved indirect call was logged; 3,578 function entries were
  observed. These scenes were inspected in captured frames.
- A 260-second fresh-save run reached first-person gameplay in the first mission
  and remained running until the test's time limit, with no logged crash or
  unresolved indirect call. It reached 3,855 instrumented functions.
  Scripted movement/look input changed the viewpoint, and trigger input reduced
  the displayed dual-weapon ammunition from 16 rounds per weapon to 14 and 13.
  Level geometry, textures, weapons, crosshair and ammunition display were
  inspected in the captured frames. This is a short gameplay check, not a
  completed mission or campaign playthrough.
- The final incremental build and native save-path tests also passed through
  Windows PowerShell 5.1, the same shell used by `Play.cmd`.
- Native PC input tests cover input clearing on focus/capture changes, consuming
  a recapture click, wheel press/release sequencing, equal mouse counts across
  different polling intervals, FOV scaling, vertical limits, inverted Y,
  normalized diagonal movement, and the actual bindings/guest-camera adapter.
- A 155-second run driven by the PC input model navigated menus with Enter,
  reached first-person gameplay, moved with W, applied raw-count camera changes,
  fired/reloaded, and switched weapons with the wheel. It ended at the test
  limit without a logged crash or unresolved indirect call. This used the
  adapter's deterministic event replay, not physical desktop input injection.
- A fresh-checkout fixture verifies that both local patches apply in Setup's
  order and reproduce all seven modified upstream files.
- A second 150-second run used the corrected aim/crouch bindings and reached
  3,874 instrumented functions with no logged crash or unresolved indirect call.
  Right-mouse aiming reduced the FOV from 55 to 30.25; a 20-count mouse event
  then changed yaw by 1.1 degrees, confirming the expected 0.55 zoom multiplier.
- The final build, both native test suites, and a six-second launcher startup
  test passed through Windows PowerShell 5.1 after the cursor activation fix.

Test output is in `logs/toolchain-tests.log`, `logs/pytest.log`,
`logs/conformance.log`, `logs/build.log`, and the timestamped smoke-test logs.
`logs/gameplay-smoke-summary.log` records the 260-second run;
`logs/final-build-check.log` records the final build and path checks.
PC input work is recorded in `logs/pc-final-bindings-build.log`,
`logs/pc-gameplay-summary.log`, and the newer `logs/pc-final-gameplay-summary.log`.
The final delivered build checks are `logs/pc-release-validation.log` and
`logs/pc-launcher-smoke.log`.
Original graphics captured by tests remain local in `private/captures`.

## Remaining work

- Verify mission progression, combat against enemies, control fidelity,
  profile reloads/checkpoints and sustained play beyond the short first-mission
  test. File creation and save isolation have been tested; a complete save/load
  gameplay round trip has not.
- Investigate translation coverage where execution requires it: the generator
  reports 50 unresolved direct-call targets emitted as diagnostic stubs, plus
  730 unsupported instruction occurrences emitted as comments/no-ops across
  30 mnemonics. Zero translation failures does not imply equivalent behavior.
- Check rendering and audio fidelity against the original game. Captured menu
  frames and host audio submissions are narrower evidence than a full playtest.
- Keyboard/mouse support currently targets player 1's first-person gameplay.
  Vehicle aiming, split-screen, MapMaker mouse navigation and extended hardware
  playtests remain unverified. Focus/capture behavior has automated state and
  activation-policy checks; no physical mouse/Alt-Tab playtest was performed.
- Aim/crouch toggle behavior follows the original game's profile. Mouse
  sensitivity/inversion is controlled by the PC configuration, independently
  of controller turn speed. The supplied PC profile selects keyboard input;
  controller input requires a controller binding configuration.
- Multiplayer and online behavior have not been tested here.

The generated C is a machine-code translation, not recovered original source.
Runtime code is pinned upstream; no claim of a completed decompilation or a
finished PC release is made.

## Interactive launcher correction (2026-10-15)

Normal play now launches through `tools/play.py`, which waits for the game and
writes its output directly to `logs/play-*.out` and `logs/play-*.err` using native
file handles. Interactive runs disable the generated code's default 400,000-line
function trace; diagnostic profiling remains available through SmokeTest.
The previous PowerShell GUI launch could return before the game, and inherited
or redirected output could stall startup. The corrected normal launch produced
captured startup logos and advancing swaps, with keyboard/mouse configuration
loaded. The user also confirmed that the logos appeared. Main-menu and gameplay
interaction for this hardware playtest is still to be tried.

## PC controls menu (2026-10-15)

Added a PC Settings → Keyboard & Mouse entry to the native game window's menu
bar, with F2 access in windowed and fullscreen modes. The owned settings dialog
lists all 24 Xbox actions with four keyboard/mouse binding slots each, mouse
sensitivity, inversion, mouse enable/disable, defaults, and Cancel. Capture
supports keys, five mouse buttons, and wheel directions; conflicting assignments
can be moved after confirmation. F1/F2/F9–F11 and Windows keys are reserved.
Gameplay input is blocked while editing, but simulation is not paused: pause
the mission first.

Saving applies bindings and mouse options immediately. Polls copy an immutable
binding snapshot under an SRW lock; editor input cannot become gameplay input.
Configuration changes preserve other ports and unrelated JSON members. Writes
use a temporary sibling file and atomic replacement, retaining the previous
configuration as `.bak`; failed writes retain the active bindings. Build checks
use a separate default fixture so user-customized bindings do not affect tests.

Validation: native input and save-path suites passed, as did the new settings
suite for live sampling, persistence and fresh-process reload, backup, unrelated
JSON retention, read-only failure, invalid values/reserved keys, defaults, native
dialog Cancel, key/wheel capture, and conflict reassignment. The UI was rendered
and visually inspected. A bounded real-game integration check verified both
entry points, F2 in fullscreen, input ownership/return, rendering after closing,
and that Cancel left the user's file unchanged. Both patches reproduced all
seven modified upstream files from pristine pinned sources. Evidence is in
`logs/pc-settings-release-validation.log` and `logs/pc-settings-game-tests.log`.

## In-game menu integration reverted (2026-10-15)

At the user's request, removed both the original-menu entry and the subsequent
game-rendered editing pages. Restored the original Xbox Settings/Options menus.
Keyboard/mouse gameplay controls, the separate F2 / PC Settings editor, and
user bindings/saves remain. Integration source is archived under
`private/rollback-in-game-menu`; generated code and the executable are rebuilt
without the guest menu wrapper or callback hooks.

Rollback validation: regeneration and Release build succeeded; save-path, PC
input/camera, and settings suites passed. A real-game UI check verified F2,
the PC Settings menu, and F2 in fullscreen; closing the editor returned input
and rendering to the game. The user configuration hash is unchanged. Logs:
`logs/revert-menu-build.log`, `logs/revert-menu-settings-ui.log`.
